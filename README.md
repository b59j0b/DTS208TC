T2. Predictive Analysis for California (55 marks)
T2-1:   Create 5 data visualisation results to show the relationships   between California’s   Median AQI   and its influencing factors (Year (2000 - 2021), Pop_Est, Good Days, Moderate D代 写DTS208TC Data Analytics and Visualisation Coursework 2Python

T2-2: Based on the visualisation results, describe the relationship between these influencing factors and the Median AQI. Using these relationships and the 2022 influencing factor data for California, predict the Median AQI for California in 2022 without relying on model training. Justify the reason of your prediction.

Reason
   
T2-3:   Train a regression model using California’s data from 2000 to 2021. The model should aim to learn the relationships between Median AQI (target variable) and its influencing factors (Year, Pop_Est, Good Days, Moderate Days, Unhealthy Days). Choose 2 evaluation metrics to evaluate your model and discuss the result.
